# AWS Instructions from Zenon

This is my list of hints and tips for different AWS courses. It’s markdown so you can save it, access it or store it anywhere. I might also give you other links that are course specific. I’ll add specific answers to questions I get during the course. I’ll share it with everyone.

**DISCLAIMER: This is a personal initiative from me as a trainer and is no way an official AWS resource.**

## Course Administration

We need to jump through some hoops to get access to the labs, notes and my hints and tips. There are three seperate sites you need to access:

- Join or login to imperial-consulting.qwiklabs.com to ensure your training and certifications are captured. **Use your corporate email**. We will not spam you or sell your details. 
    - Access Qwiklabs (yes it is spelt INCORRECTLY) 
        - https://imperial-consulting.qwiklabs.com for the labs in this class (use your corporate email)
        - run.qwiklabs.com for outside of the class or to do other labs at your own pace. 
        - NOTE: Some are free others require course credits. Also check out the AWS Professional Developer Series of MOOCs on edX https://www.edx.org/aws-developer-professional-series 
- Access the course notes and slides. You'll receive an email confirming your attendance at this course and with the following links.
    - www.vitalsource.com look for a signup link and download link. Or just go to https://evantage.gilmoreglobal.com/#/user/signin
    - Once you've logged into Vitalsource (aka Bookshelf, Gilmore, eVantage) you can redeem your unique course materials code (in a seperate email) and update your book list. You should see a lab guid and student guide for the course/s you are taking. The student guide is the powerpoint decks and notes and the lab guide is the step by step instructions for the labs.
    You can download the Vitalsource Bookshelf app for Windows, Mac, IoS and Android at https://support.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/201344733-Bookshelf-Download-Page
    - If you have trouble printing the student and lab guides to pdf, check the page numbers as they may have trailing spaces
