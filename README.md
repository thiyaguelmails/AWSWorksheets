# AWS Tips from Zenon

This is my list of hints and tips for different AWS courses. It’s markdown so you can save it, access it or store it anywhere. I might also give you other links that are course specific. I’ll add specific answers to questions I get during the course. I’ll share it with everyone.

**DISCLAIMER: This is a personal initiative from me as a trainer and is no way an official AWS resource.**

## Course Administration

We need to jump through some hoops to get access to the labs, notes and my hints and tips. There are three seperate sites you need to access:

- Join or login to imperial-consulting.qwiklabs.com to ensure your training and certifications are captured. **Use your corporate email**. We will not spam you or sell your details. 
    - Access Qwiklabs (yes it is spelt INCORRECTLY) 
        - imperial-consulting.qwiklabs.com for the labs in this class (use your corporate email)
        - run.qwiklabs.com for outside of the class or to do other labs at your own pace. 
        - NOTE: Some are free others require course credits. Also check out the AWS Professional Developer Series of MOOCs on edX https://www.edx.org/aws-developer-professional-series
